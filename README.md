# ⚡ FlexBot

**The Ultimate On-Demand Browser Automation Tool.**

FlexBot is a lightweight, high-performance Chrome Extension designed for "Grind Mode." It allows you to map any website button (like "Next", "Skip", or "Submit") to a keyboard shortcut of your choice.

Unlike other bots, FlexBot stays **dormant** until you need it, injects a sleek **Glassmorphism UI** only when requested, and can be completely unloaded with a single click.

## 🚀 Features

* **On-Demand Architecture:** Does not run in the background. Only loads when you click the extension icon.
* **Modern UI:** Draggable, semi-transparent "Glass" overlay that fits any modern web aesthetic.
* **Smart Docking:** The floating bubble magnetically snaps to the nearest screen edge.
* **Persistence:** Remembers your window position, minimized state, and active rules even after page reloads.
* **Stealth Mode:** Minimizes into a tiny ⚡ bubble to keep your workspace clear.
* **Zero-Inference:** No data collection. Everything runs locally in your browser.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Finding Selectors:** Right-click the button you want to automate, select **Inspect**, and look for `id="something"`. Enter `#something` in FlexBot.
* **Classes:** If there is no ID, use the class name with a dot (e.g., `.btn-primary`).
* **Auto-Fix:** If you forget the `#` for an ID, FlexBot's smart logic will attempt to add it for you automatically.

🎉 **That's it!** You will see the FlexBot logo appear in your browser toolbar.
